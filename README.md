# Python building blocks

This is a project based on The Odin Project's [Ruby curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/building-blocks). I'm interested in becoming more confident in my Python skills moreso than Ruby and thus I will be focusing on Python and Django for web development.
